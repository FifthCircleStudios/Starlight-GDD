#### Storyline & Setting

**Storyline:**  
The story of Starlight unfolds in the wake of the Second Renaissance, a golden age of technological and societal advancement abruptly ended by a cosmic disaster. The Cataclysm, triggered by a fail-safe from the Elyndari, a mysterious precursor race, unleashed widespread chaos. Humanity's once-advanced technology faltered, causing environmental collapse, celestial disturbances, and alien invasions. Players step into the shoes of the Ascendant, individuals resurrected from death with extraordinary abilities due to cybernetic malfunctions during the Cataclysm. As members of the Eternal Order, the Ascendant are dedicated to reclaiming lost glory and rebuilding civilization. With fragmented memories of their past lives and special powers reminiscent of those found in Destiny 2, they embark on a quest for redemption and restoration.

**Setting:**  
In the shattered remnants of a once-great civilization, Starlight thrusts players into a post-apocalyptic Earth ravaged by cosmic upheavals and advanced technology gone awry. After the cataclysmic event known as the Cataclysm, humanity has been reduced to three remaining cities‚ÄîLondon, Elysium, and The Boneyard‚Äîand isolated colonies scattered across a hostile wasteland. The game features a richly detailed world where nature and technology intertwine, creating a stark contrast between crumbling urban landscapes and lush, overgrown ruins.
